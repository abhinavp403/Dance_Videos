This app is vertical scrollable view containing embedded popular bollywood music videos from youtube. The inspiration to make this app is to quickly open and find a music video of your liking and see the hookstep
dance move instead of trying to find it yourself. The video starts at the point the hookstep starts and stops on its own after a certain time interval, hence it makes the navigation and ease of watching the
dance move much faster. Each video can also be toggeable to view in fullscreen format too. Logic is setup in such a way that it's easy to add more videos in the future.
